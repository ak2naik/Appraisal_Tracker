ABOUT THE PROJECT:


This project is aimed at developing an Appraisal Tracker that is of importance to either an organization or a college. 
This Appraisal Tracker system is used to track the performance of an individual. 
An individual’s performance is rated by himself and his superior in the organization. 
Performance appraisal is the process of obtaining, analyzing and recording information about the relative worth of an employee. 
The focus of the performance appraisal is measuring and improving the actual performance of the employee and also the future potential 
of the employee. 
The tasks for the next 6 months are set by the superior. 
The performance rating is done based on several attributes (like the timeliness, quality of work, communication skills etc).
The system consists of two main components:
•	A front end which provides access to the application function to the end user
•	A site administration end which provides a management interface for 
	application administrators to add, delete, and modify records, settings, 
	and preferences in the system as well generate reports from the database.
